# How to Build a Successful Team

Building a successful team is about more than finding a group of people with the right mix of professional skills

the art of fostering a strong sense of teamwork. Be by insights can help you lay the groundwork for a highly productive team that can communicate, cooperate and innovate in an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect.

## Make a Plan
You need a clear and measurable goal for what you want to accomplish.

Hiring Well Isn't Enough
 “If you have more than three priorities, you don’t have any.” — Jim Collins, author of the best-selling management books “Good to Great” and “Built to Last.”


- Create a Clear Map

- Have a Shared Scoreboard

- You May Feel Like a Broken Record...

## Rules of the Road
You’ll need a set of values, behaviors and cultural guardrails so that everybody knows how to work together.

Create Your Team's Culture
“I think it’s easy for people at many companies to become cynical, which then leads to politics, which can create a cancer that can topple even the greatest companies.” — Kathy Savitt, managing director at Perch Partners, a consulting firm.

The most important thing is for the team or company to live by their stated values, rather than just going through the motions of the exercise, with people earning promotions even though their behavior runs directly counter to the stated rules of the road. 


A couple of other traps to avoid:

- **Don’t make your lists too long**. Most people can’t remember more than three things day-to-day, and the lists don’t need to somehow address all potential human behavior, good and bad. Just focus on the things that feel unique to the group or organization, and are good reminders to keep everyone aligned and moving forward.
- **Specific is better than vague**.
 Many lists of values share similar words, like excellence and integrity, but those broad notions can create problems of their own, said Michel Feaster of Usermind, a customer-engagement software firm. “The problem with values like respect and courage is that everybody interprets them differently,” she said. “They’re too ambiguous and open to interpretation. Instead of uniting us, they can create friction.”

## Show a Little Respect

If team members don’t feel respected, they won’t be motivated to bring their best ideas — and their best selves — to work.

The Effects of a Bad Boss
"We make everyone understand that the reason the culture works is that we have that respect. There is a comfort level and a feeling of safety inside our business.” — John Duffy, chief executive of the mobile-technology company 3Cinteractive.


## It's About the Team
A team is stronger when everybody delivers on their individual roles.

Accountability Goes Both Ways
"You just need people who follow through, and it’s a lot more fun when the people you work with do that." — Brett Wilson, chief executive of TubeMogul, a video advertising software company.


## Have Conversations
Difficult discussions aren’t anyone’s idea of fun — but they are necessary for running a successful team.

Stay On Your Side of the Net
"Having those good conversations is really 80 percent of being an effective manager.” — Seth Besmertnik, chief executive of Conductor, a search engine optimization company.

you should never make statements that include assumptions about the motivations behind someone’s behavior. Instead, you should stay on your side of the net and talk only about what you’re observing and your own reactions and feelings. That way, it’s harder for people to get their back up because you’re not devising rationales to explain someone else’s behavior. 

Consider, for example, the small but important difference in approaches in the following paragraph: 

- "I’ve noticed you keep showing up 20 minutes late, and it seems like you don’t care." The boss has gone over the net here and accused the person of not caring. 
- "I’ve noticed you keep showing up 20 minutes late, and it makes me feel like you don’t care." Here, with just a small language tweak, the boss is staying on the right side of the net, and avoided an overheated conversation because the employee can’t argue about how someone feels.
